# Description

## Generator

Starts and produces data for specified period of time (`timeout_s`).
Every generator might produce several data sources (dataIds).
For every data source, value changes in time starting with initial point (`init_value`) and increases randomly with max step (`max_change_step`).

## Message queue

Basic FIFO buffer with single input and multiple output.
Queue output should be implemented as pub / sub broker.
Once all generators are stopped, queue must be notified about that event in order to notify all output listeners.

## Aggregator

Starts and aggregates data while input channel is "alive".
Aggregation processing:

- collect all incoming data for specified period of time (`agregate_period_s`);
- calculate average value for every dataId;
- send average values to Storage;
- start new aggregation iteration;
  Sending data to Storage should be asynchronous.

## Data format

{
"id": "data_1",
"value": 50
}

## Abstract storage

Unified interface to store integer value with corresponding name (id).
Every value added to the Storage is a new line (new entry), so no aggregation here.
Storage type is specified in config file.

# Requirements

- only Golang standard libraries. App could be written with the help of Cobra framework. No queue brokers;
- application should react to SIGINT UNIX signal and stop all workers gracefully;
- application should be packed into docker container;
- application should not require any preparation steps, but run docker container, with some parameters if needed;
- application should have short Readme with application running instructions.
